# Art_Capsul
This Repository is dedicated to hold the Art Capsul Project.
This will also the recreation of the old first project and will try to compare them in the end of the code progress.

## What is my goal?
Goal is to have a much clean html syntax.
Have a much less and more advance CSS.
And a proper working slider and other animations like Mobile navbar.
